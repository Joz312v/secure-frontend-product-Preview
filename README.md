## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (mobile & desktop responsive).
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements such as buttons.
- Adjust the product quantity dynamically with a working cart system.

## My process

### Built with

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **API Proxy:** Express-based API proxy for security
- **Deployment:** Railway (backend & API proxy), GitHub (frontend code)
### Features Implemented:
‚úÖ Fully responsive design for desktop & mobile  
‚úÖ Secure API setup with a proxy server to hide backend URLs  
‚úÖ Dynamic cart functionality (adjust product quantity)  
‚úÖ API-driven data fetching to update pricing  
‚úÖ Smooth UI interactions with hover/focus effects  

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my frontend and backend development skills, especially in the areas of JavaScript, API security, and deployment.

```js
// Fetch the backend URL dynamically from the API Proxy
fetch("/api/get-urls")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    const proxyAPI = data.proxyAPI; // Get hidden backend URL

    // Use the proxy API to fetch secret data securely
    fetch(`${proxyAPI}/api/get-secret`)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => {
        document.querySelector(".price").textContent = `$${data.totalPrice}`;
        document.querySelector(".quantity").textContent = data.quantity;
      })
      .catch((error) => console.error("Error fetching data:", error));
  });

```
### Setting Up a Backend with CORS
Initially, I faced issues where the frontend couldn‚Äôt communicate with the backend due to CORS policy errors. I learned how to configure CORS correctly for multiple origins.

```js
app.use(cors({
  origin: ["link here"],
  methods: ["GET", "POST"],
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type"],
  credentials: true
}));

```
- **API security:** Using a proxy to hide backend URLs.
- **CORS fixes:** Allowing cross-origin requests correctly.
- **Dynamic data updates:** Keeping product quantity in the backend instead of localStorage.
- **Hosting frontend via Express:** Serving everything from one domain.
- **Executing hidden JavaScript:** Keeping sensitive JS logic protected.

### Continued development

While working on this project, I realized there are several areas I would like to continue improving and refining in future projects:

- üîê Enhancing API Security ‚Äì Although I implemented an API proxy to hide backend URLs, I want to explore JWT authentication or API keys for better security in future applications.
- üíæ Storing User-Specific Data ‚Äì Currently, the quantity updates are stored per session. I want to integrate a database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to allow users to persist their cart state across sessions.
- ‚ö° Improving Performance & Caching ‚Äì I plan to optimize API requests and responses using server-side caching (Redis) to improve speed and reduce unnecessary backend calls.
- üì± Progressive Web App (PWA) ‚Äì I want to make future projects installable as PWAs for a better mobile experience with offline functionality.
- üé® Advanced Animations ‚Äì While I added hover states, I want to learn and apply GSAP or Framer Motion for smoother, high-quality animations in UI interactions.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) ‚Äì This guide helped me properly configure CORS policies when setting up the API proxy.
- [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html) ‚Äì I used this to learn how to      serve static files, set up API routes, and implement  middleware for JSON parsing and CORS handling.
- [JavaScript Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) ‚Äì Helped refine my understanding of handling API requests and responses in JavaScript.
- [Node.js Best Practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices) ‚Äì A great resource that helped me structure my backend properly and improve code security.
